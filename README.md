***The art of simplicity is a puzzle of complexity.***

## Overview ##
[YAML](http://yaml.org) is a data serialization format designed for human readability and interaction with scripting languages.

SnakeYAML is a YAML 1.1 processor for the Java Virtual Machine version 7.
For YAML 1.2 (which is a superset of JSON) you may have a look at [SnakeYAML Engine](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml-engine)
